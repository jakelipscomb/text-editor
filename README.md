## Description
The purpose of this project was to build a text editor that runs in the browser. The app would be a single-page application that meets the PWA criteria. Additionally, it would feature a number of data persistence techniques that serve as redundancy in case one of the options is not supported by the browser. By creating notes or code snippets with or without an internet connection, this project would be useful to retrieve information stored for later use.

    Express ver. ^4.17.1

    Webpack: ^5.51.1
    webpack-cli: ^4.8.0,
